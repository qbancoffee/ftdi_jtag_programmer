# FTDI JTAG Programmer
An inexpensive JTAG programmer for Xilinx CPLD's using an FT232 usb to serial converter

Disclaimer:<br>
This is not my own original project but rather an attempt to organize what I found on the internet that ultimately helped me program the CPLD in the SAMx4 project.


## Intro
I'm a Tandy Color Computer enthusiast that especially enjoys the hardware side of things. 
When I learned that Ciaran Ascomb had recreated the SAM chip, a chip used in the Dragon and Tandy Color Computer's,
I immediately cloned his repository and began modifying his design for my use.

Ciarans project is called the SAMx4 and it's built around a Xilinx XC95144XL CPLD. The code was written in VHDL using the older Xilinx ISE 14.7 development environment.
Xilinx ISE has a module called Impact which is used to  program the CPLD using a Xilinx supported debugger(programmer). I don't own a Xilinx programmer so I decided to search for another approach.
The idea is to take an inexpensive FTDI based USB to Serial converter and use it as a JTAG programmer by bit banging the I/O pins.
There are many FTDI bases USB to serial converters but for this one you'll have to use one based on the FT232RL chip. I had a [Black FTDI Friend](https://learn.adafruit.com/ftdi-friend/overview) by Adafruit lying around so I used that.


Here are the steps to compile the project and program the CPLD.

- [Download/clone the SAMx4 project.](#Downloadclone-the-SAMx4-project)
- [Download and install Xilinx ISE 14.7](#Download-and-install-Xilinx-ISE-147)
- [Open the project with Xilinx ISE 14.7](#Open-the-project-with-Xilinx-ISE-147)
- [Implement the top module(compile) to produce a JED file](#Implement-the-top-module-to-produce-a-JED-file)
- [Use Impact CLI to produce an SVF file from the JED file](#Use-Impact-CLI-to-produce-an-SVF-file-from-the-JED-file)
- [Compile the CPLD programmer](#Compile-the-CPLD-programmer)
- [Programming the CPLD](#Programming-the-CPLD)


Here are the steps to load it onto the CPLD.
- [Download and install the FTDI D2XX drivers](#Download-and-install-the-FTDI-D2XX-drivers)


## Here are the steps to compile the project and program the CPLD.

  ### Download/clone the SAMx4 project
  Get the project source files from [here.](https://www.6809.org.uk/dragon/samx4/)
  ### Download and install Xilinx ISE 14.7
  [Download Xilinx ISE 14.7 for your operating system](https://www.xilinx.com/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/archive-ise.html)

  ### Open the project with Xilinx ISE 14.7
  ### Implement the top module to produce a JED file
  ### Use Impact CLI to produce an SVF file from the JED file
  
  ## Here are the steps to load it onto the CPLD.
  ### Download and install the FTDI D2XX drivers
    

  Since I use Linux I'll go over what I did for my installation.
  I used [this](https://ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/AppNotes/AN_220_FTDI_Drivers_Installation_Guide_for_Linux.pdf) guide to install the libraries and headers but I'll just paste the necessary commands below.
At the time of this writing the D2XX library was version 1.4.27 so you'll have adjust accordingly if using a different version.

  [Download the driver for your OS](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/)

Once downloaded, extract the files and navigate to the direcory where the files were extracted and enter the following commands using a terminal.
```bash
sudo cp release/build/lib* /usr/local/lib
```
Make the following symbolic links and permission modifications in /usr/local/lib:
```bash
cd /usr/local/lib
sudo ln â€“s libftd2xx.so.1.4.27 libftd2xx.so
sudo chmod 0755 libftd2xx.so.1.4.27   
```
Type the following to see if your user is part of the plugdev group.
```bash
groups
```
If your user is not you can add it by typing the following.
```bash
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
```
You'll need to log out and then back in for this change to take effect however I've noticed that this doesn't always work and a reboot is required.


### Compile the CPLD programmer
Someone wrote a small program that bitbangs the FT232RL chip to be used as a JTAG programmer and you can get it from [here](https://tulip-house.ddo.jp/digital/PROG_CPLD/index.html). I've included the program and the source from this site in this repository and you can find it in the "prog_cpld_original" directory.

I slightly modified the source so that it now compiles under Linux. You can find the modified source and an x86 64 bit binary in the "prog_cpld_linux" directory.

You can compile this program under Linux with gcc.
```bash
gcc -o prog_cpld prog_cpld.c -lftd2x
```

### Programming the CPLD

If you are using Windows you'll need to remove the VCP(Virtual COM Port) drivers and install the D2XX direct USB access drivers.
If you are using Linux then you'll need to temporarily unload the VCP(Virtual COM Port) module and install the D2XX direct USB access static and shared libraries.

Plug in the FT232RL based USB to serial converter. At this point, linux will load the built-in VCP module and create a file named
something like /dev/ttyUSB0 which means that the OS recognized it and loaded the FTDI virtual com port module. Since we want direct USB access to the FT232 chip, we'll need to temporarily remove this module.

To see the loaded module type the following
```bash
lsmod | grep ftdi
```

To temporarily remove the module type the following.
```bash
sudo rmmod ftdi_sio
```

Make sure the module is no longer loaded.
```bash
lsmod | grep ftdi
```
Keep in mind that you'll have to repeat these steps if you unplug and plug it back in.

The original program "PROG_CPLD.exe" is Windows program and although I have not tested it, you should be able to just run it from a command prompt with the following command.
```dos
PROG_CPLD -v -c samx4.svf
```
Similarly you can program the CPLD with the linux executable
```bash
./prog_cpld -v -c samx4.svf
```
"samx4.svf" is the [SVF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Vector_Format) file produced for the CPLD in the SAMx4 PCB.

You'll see lots of stuff scrolling and if successfuly yo'll see a maessage that reads.
